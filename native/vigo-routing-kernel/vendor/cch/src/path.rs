//! Shortcut path unpacking — node-path reconstruction after a CCH query.
//!
//! Provides [`node_path`], shortcut unpacking, and reusable query state.
//!
//! The algorithm is a bidirectional elimination-tree search that records
//! predecessors in both the forward and backward sweeps, selects the
//! meeting node exactly as routingkit does (strict `<` update along the
//! backward ancestor walk), and then recursively unpacks each shortcut arc
//! via a merge-join over the lower-triangle down-neighbour lists — choosing
//! the FIRST witness, matching routingkit's `unpack_forward_arc` /
//! `unpack_backward_arc`.
